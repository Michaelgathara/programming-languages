# Programming Languages
A collection of projects I wrote while learning the world of Programming Language research.

- Written in the functional programming language Racket.

Each file is named to describe what is inside. 
- `cesk_star.rkt` - Control Evaluation Continuation Store Star Machine
- `interp_capture.rkt` - An eager implementation of general lambda calculus evaluation methods, Call by Value, Call by Name, Capture Avoiding Substitution
- `interp_capture_lazy.rkt` - interp_capture but not eager
- `simple-cek.rkt` - An implementation of a Control Evaluation Continuation Machine
- `small_step.rkt` - An implementation of a small step interpreter
- `transitive.rkt` - Transitive Closure in Racket
- `map_reduce.rkt` - The famous map reduce algorithm in Racket
